# Secret Santa

Secret Santa is a game where each member of the family is assigned another
member of the family to give a gift to for Christmas. Each pairing is known only
to the person making the gift. Nobody knows who is getting them a gift, hence
the name _Secret Santa_.

## Why does this tool exist?

When organising a Secret Santa with my family, we realised we wanted to respect
certain conditions that existing Secret Santa services could not provide. The
constraints are:

1. The chain of Santas makes a single large loop.
2. Nobody gets assigned someone in their immediate family.
   - Our extended family is composed of 4 "sub-families".
